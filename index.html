                    Hello, my name is Emir Velazquez and I am an aspiring Developer.
                    My goal is to join a company that needs excellent individuals to depend on.
                    I became interested in development because I've always had a passion for building things.
                    When I was younger I used to build all sorts of toys and also got involved with a lot of art.
                    One of the main art mediums I enjoyed working with was Sculpture.
                    Another thing I really love is techology, especially computers and video games.   
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After working full time and trying to still further my higher education, I decided to take both of my loves for art sculpting and technology.
                    No better place to do that then by learning how to write code. 
                    It is basically like making a sculpture using programming languages and I find it very challenging and rewarding.
                    I am excited to be able to join a develpment team soon and continue to expand my knowledge. 
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction! </p>
